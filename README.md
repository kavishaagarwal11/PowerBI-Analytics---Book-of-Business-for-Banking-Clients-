# PowerBI Analytics -Book of Business for Banking Clients

This project includes the Power BI dashboard created by Kavisha for analysis of ‘Book of Business’ of Banking clients. The data used in this project is a sample data generated using random functions in excel to replicate the type of data that I was retrieving from database using SQL queries in my previous job.  

The data model has dimensions tables and fact tables.
Dimension Tables:
1) Customer Info – This includes all know-your-customer information about clients like address, gender, contact number, employer, income etc. 
2) Account Details – This includes information about different type of accounts available in the bank for clients. 
Fact tables:
1) Mortgage –This includes mortgage details of all clients who have a mortgage
2) Investments – This includes different type of investment accounts each client has
3) Credit Card – This includes credit card details of each client who has a credit card
4) Accounts D2D – This includes the chequing and savings account details and balances each account has per client
5) Last Contact – This table gives the details of when each client was contacted last time
There were few other calculated tables created to get the desired output for analysis.
